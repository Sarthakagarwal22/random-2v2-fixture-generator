# random-2v2-fixture-generator

A simple Javascript application where in you can make fixtures for 2v2 matches for any sport. It tries to generates truly random matches, which means no repeat teams, but if the input is extremely large, it gives you another option to generate fixtures where non-repition of teams is not guaranteed. 

The application is live [here](https://sarthakagarwal22.github.io/random-2v2-fixture-generator/)
